/* 
  Syncthing is a free and open source peer-to-peer file synchronization application 
  and can be enabled as an option in NixOS with full configuration from here.

  A practical use of configuring Syncthing via NixOS is to have the program 
  up and running immediately; if synced with a server and shared folders, 
  they will already be synchronized.

  For more details, see:
